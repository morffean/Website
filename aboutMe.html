<p style="font-family:verdana">I'm James Lee and 30 years old. I've been playing piano for almost 23 years and I don't think there is anything else in the world that I would rather do. I first started playing the piano through OSAA's Piano Syllabus levels which I reached level 10 by my freshman year in High School.<br>I've been a part of the orchestra, band, jazz band, and had the opportunity to participate in a Master Classe before I graduated from High School.</p>
